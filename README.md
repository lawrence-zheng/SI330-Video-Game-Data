# SI330-Video-Game-Data
Final project for the SI330 data science course at the University of Michigan.

I took a dataset logging the activity of people using the Steam video game distribution platform and a database storing information about video games, and used it to create data visualizations on factors affecting the average total playtime of a video game. 

See the enclosed PDF file (Final Project Report.pdf) for a report on the results.
