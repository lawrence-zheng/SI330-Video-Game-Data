# SI330-Video-Game-Data
Final project for the SI330 data science course at the University of Michigan. I took a dataset logging the activity of people using the Steam video game distribution platform and a database storing information about video games, and used it to create data visualizations on factors affecting the average total playtime of a video game. See the enclosed PDF file for a report on the results.
